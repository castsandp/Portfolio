                <h3>Locations</h3>
                <p>The different locations for a style sheet in would be internal, 
                    externam and embedded. In my website the main form of styling is 
                    in the main.css file. I use embeded exculsivly in the style.html head/style 
                    section. When it comes to inline I use it for the style
                </p>

                <h3>Selectors</h3>
                <p>There are multiple selctors available, usualy there will be one available for
                    every tag type, aside from that these are pseudo selectors that can be added to existing 
                    selectors to add aditioal styling. Some of the ones that I used were fieldset, which specififed
                    the background color of my form page. I also used the h3 sleector to change a collective font size.
                    It is also posible ot create unique groups and change those with the .calss-name selector specififer. Same thing with ID. I used
                    a .radio and .homeGuide selctor for my two classes and an id selector called #I-link and #tableTitle 
                </p>

                <h3>Box Model</h3>
                <p>The box model is the concept that each section or html element has 4 parts. One being the contnet part and from there it can have a 
                    border. The border and the content are seperated by the padding section. The border of one element and another element are seprated by each
                    elements margin. So it does content, padding, border margin for each element, like multiple boxes growin outwords. I used the box model to help me style the header and main sections.
                    I have both of them some sort of border and neeed to have space between the border and the ocntent so I added padding. I needed hte two borders to be seperated so I added
                    margins to each! </p>

                <h3>Inheritance & Specificity</h3>
                <p>Inheritance and Specificity are kind of similar. Inheritance mean that if for example the entir body tag is fiven a specififc color in the styling sheet it will give everything
                    it hold that same color unless specififed other wise. That happens in my contatc.html file where I give form a background color but then I giveo ne to fieldset changing the background color for that.
                    Specificity on the other hand dealth with one specififc tab but within that tag there are attributes that make it more specififc. In turn the more specififc in the case of
                    conflixting instructions will win. This can be seen in the in the label selector which gives that text a specififc color but in home page althought hte table title is also a label since it was given an ID it 
                    follows the isntructions of the ID selector.
