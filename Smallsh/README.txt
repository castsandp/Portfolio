Description:
The main goal of this program was to create a shell. This shell uses forking and execvp which allows it to process diffrent types of command line commands.
There are three built in functions being cd, exit, and status - that have their own specififed fucntionlity betweeen the program. This shell supports directory change, comment lines and blank lines. It can take in signals such as crtl z and ctrl c which have speciffiec actions. This shell supports redirection and foreground as well background processes. Overall it should simulate a linux shell.
